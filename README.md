# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

## Description of the project
Our project is to create a clone of Airbnb, a website where people can rent properties. We'll have a toolto manage data easily (Console: Command Line Interface or CLI) during development. The website will include both fixed (static) and interactiv  e (dynamic) features for users. We're setting up a system to store important information (Database) such as property details and user data. To ensure smooth communication between the front and back parts of the website, we're incorporating a special interface (API or Application Programming Interface). The goal is to replicate the user-friendly and functional experience of Airbnb.

### General concepts
These are the concepts for this project:
- How to create a Python package
- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- How to manage datetime
- What is an UUID
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Files and Directories
- ```models``` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project.
- ```tests``` directory will contain all unit tests.
- ```console.py``` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
- ```models/base_model.py``` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    - attributes: ```id```, ```created_at``` and ```updated_at```
    - methods: ```save()``` and ```to_json()```
- ```models/engine``` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment I will have only one: ```file_storage.py```.

## Project's implementation
### Phase One
The first phase is to manipulate a powerful storage system to give an abstraction between objects and how they are stored and persisted. To achieve this, I will:
- put in place a parent class (called ```BaseModel```) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of my future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (```User, State, City, Place…```) that inherit from ```BaseModel```
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
- Create a data model
- Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console/command interpreter
- Store and persist objects to files (JSON files)
## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
## Description of the command interpreter
| Commands  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```quit```  | Quits the console  |
| ```Ctrl+D```  | Quits the console  |
| ```create <class>```  | Creates an object of type , saves it to a JSON file, and prints the objects ID
| ```show <class> <ID>```  | Shows string representation of an object
| ```destroy <class> <ID>```  | Deletes an objects
| ```all or all <class>```  | Prints all string representations of all objects or Prints all string representations of all objects of a specific class
| ```update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"```  | Updates an object with a certain attribute (new or existing)
| ```<class>.all()```  | Same as all ```<class>```
| ```<class>.show(<ID>)```  | Same as show ```<class> <ID>```
| ```<class>.destroy(<ID>)```  | Same as destroy ```<class> <ID>```
| ```<class>.update(<ID>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>```  | Same as update ```<class> <ID> <attribute name> <attribute value>```
## General Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
